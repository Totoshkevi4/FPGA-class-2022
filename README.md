# FPGA-class-2022 (VHDL 2008)

This is repository with my hometasks for FPGA class.

Started with pretty simple programmes (some of files in *Basics* folder are not synthesizable).
Most of them are commented-through or very simple. They are synthesizable unless otherwise stated.

Used Active-HDL as IDE and Quartus II 13.0 for synthesis check.
